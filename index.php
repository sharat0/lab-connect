                imparts integrated teaching in major areas of Life sciences like Genetics, Microbiology, Biochemistry
                and Biotechnology. The department boasts state-of-the-art laboratory that provide an arena for students
                to study the modern surroundings and to have hands on practical knowledge in thrust areas of life
                science.The essence of science is hands on training and experimentation of theoretical concepts which
                makes learning complete. There are four laboratories in the college to carry out experiments in
                Biotechnology, Microbiology, Biochemistry and Genetics. These labs are adequately equipped with
                sophisticated gadgets and instruments as thermal cycler (PCR machine), U.V. spectrophotometer, U.V.
                Transilluminator, Image Capture device, Gerber Centrifuge, Deep freezer, Digital colony counter, etc.
                The scientific temper, imagination and creativity of students are exhibited as they are encouraged to
                propose projects and carry out the same in the labs of the college. Such activities are not part of the
                University syllabus, but are initiatives of the department.

            <p data-aos="fade-up">Physics is the study of nature in an attempt to understand how the universe behaves. The study, from the
                smallest subatomic particle to the largest galaxies, enables the students to apply this knowledge to
                analyze physical phenomena and problem-solving in scientific aspects. The study of physics creates new
                ideas, methods to solve daily life problems and it motivates to formulate new scientific theories and
                stimulates to find new innovation in a digital era. The study of physics is very interesting and
                mind-blowing because it is the foundation for all other science fields. Career opportunity in physics
                spreads from a research lab to industries and healthcare to space and astronomy.</p>
